Creating a simple two-player local chess game

Here's a simple outline for creating a two-player chess game:

## Project Structure
```
chess-game/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── images/ (chess piece sprites)
```

## Core Components

### HTML Structure
- 8x8 grid container for the chessboard
- Square divs with coordinate classes (a1-h8)
- Game info display (current player, status)

### CSS Styling
- Alternating light/dark squares
- Piece positioning and sprites
- Hover effects and move highlighting
- Responsive board sizing

### JavaScript Logic

**1. Game State Management**
- Board array (8x8) representing piece positions
- Current player tracking
- Game status (playing, check, checkmate, stalemate)

**2. Piece Classes**
- Base Piece class with common properties
- Individual piece classes (Pawn, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, King)
- Each with specific movement validation

**3. Core Functions**
- `initializeBoard()` - Set up starting positions
- `renderBoard()` - Update DOM with current state
- `handleSquareClick()` - Process player moves
- `isValidMove()` - Check move legality
- `makeMove()` - Execute valid moves
- `isInCheck()` - Check detection
- `switchPlayer()` - Toggle turns

**4. Move Validation**
- Path checking (no piece blocking)
- Piece-specific movement rules
- Check/checkmate detection
- Castling and en passant (optional)

## Implementation Steps
1. Create basic HTML board structure
2. Style the chessboard and pieces
3. Implement piece movement logic
4. Add game state management
5. Handle special rules and win conditions

This gives you a playable local two-player chess game. You can expand with features like move history, time controls, or online multiplayer later.
